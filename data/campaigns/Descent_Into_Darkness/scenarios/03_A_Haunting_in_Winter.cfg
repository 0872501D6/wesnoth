            story=_ "Malin and Darken Volk spend the summer and fall traveling across the lower Northlands. They attack goblin villages and small orc camps when they find them. Although Darken Volk is occasionally demanding and irritable, he proves to be an effective mentor. Malin’s power grows considerably under the necromancer’s tutelage."

            story=_ "The colored patchwork of fall eventually fades to ashen winter. The first flakes of snowfall drift over the barren lands as the air grows ever colder. The nights grow longer as the sun disappears behind a seemingly perpetual mist of pallid clouds. Hounded by the elements, the two necromancers retreat into the hills to seek shelter."
