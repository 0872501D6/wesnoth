Several hours west, he finally stops after several days bereft of rest or sleep. He closes his eyes, trying to purge the last few hours from his mind, but the darkness only makes the images all the more vivid. He is tired, <i>so</i> tired, but sleep does not come."

No regrets...”</i> He quells the voice. Sleep comes, long stretches of dreamless darkness punctuated briefly by nightmarish forms, distorted, grotesque things that whisper in eerily familiar voices. <i>‘You are cursed, Malin the Damned! Cursed! Cursed. Cursed...’</i> They echo over and over, first a choir of voices, then a duet, both male, then just one. One voice alone in the darkness."
